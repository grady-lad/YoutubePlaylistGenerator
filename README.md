# YoutubePlaylistGenerator

Web browsers allow you to export bookmarks as html files, the aim of this application is to read in that html
file and create youtube playlists depending on the amount of youtube videos contained in the file (200 vids per playlist).

This app is served on a node.js server which is reponsible for reading the pages.
React is used to generate the views and relay the progress information to the user.
